# Figr-Assignment

This repository is dedicated to the assignment given by Figr, where the task is to simulate function calling using open-source LLMs. 
The project directory contains the notebook `figr_assignment_final.ipynb`, which goes into detail about the process and the approaches 
used. 

Any feedback is appreciated!
